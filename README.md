# ProductCatalogAPI

A robust, extensible ASP.NET Core Web API for managing product catalogs, categories, and users, built with modern **.NET 8** and **C# 12** features.

The solution follows **clean architecture principles**, leverages **MediatR** for **CQRS and notifications**, and is designed for **scalability**, **maintainability**, and **testability**.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Product Management:** CRUD operations for products with category association.
- **Category Management:** Manage product categories.
- **User Management:** Role-based authorization and authentication.
- **CQRS Pattern:** Command and Query separation using MediatR.
- **Event Notifications:** Decoupled event handling for actions like product addition.
- **Logging:** Centralized application logging with event-driven log creation.
- **Global Error Handling:** Consistent error responses and exception management.
- **Pagination:** Efficient data paging for large result sets.
- **Extensible Repository Pattern:** Generic repository for data access abstraction.

## üß± Architecture Overview

The solution is structured around **Clean Architecture** and **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)** principles:

- **API Layer:** Exposes RESTful endpoints using ASP.NET Core controllers. Handles HTTP requests, model validation, and response formatting.
- **Features Layer:** Contains business logic grouped by domain features (e.g., Products, Categories). Each feature includes Commands, Queries, Handlers, and Events.
- **Common Layer:** Shared utilities, middleware, base classes, and infrastructure (e.g., logging, error handling, repositories).
- **Data Access Layer:** Uses Entity Framework Core for database operations, abstracted via repositories.
- **MediatR:** Decouples request handling (commands/queries) and notifications (events), promoting single responsibility and testability.
- **Event Handlers:** Listen for domain events (e.g., `ProductAddedEvent`) and perform side effects such as logging.

## üß† Key Patterns & Technologies

- **Repository Pattern:** Abstracts data access for testability and flexibility.
- **MediatR:** Implements CQRS and event-driven architecture.
- **Dependency Injection:** All services and handlers are registered for DI.
- **Global Middleware:** Handles cross-cutting concerns like error handling and logging.
